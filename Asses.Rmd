## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + xlab('Cylinders') + ylab('Number of Cars') +
   ggtitle('Distribution of Cars by Cylinders')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(cyl, mpg, data = mtcars, colour = cyl, geom = "point",     
  ylab = "Miles per Gallon", xlab = "No. of Cylinders",
  main = "Impact of Number of Cylinders on MPG")     
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point() +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  xlab("No. of Horsepower") +
  ggtitle("Impact of Number of Horsepower on MPG")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
